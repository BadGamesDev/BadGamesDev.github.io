      <p class="about-image-caption">Exquisite Avatar Resembling My Distinguished Persona</p>
    </div>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Who is Can Demirayak? No doubt, this question has been pondered by countless great minds throughout history. It echoes through the annals of time, captivating the imagination of scholars, scientists, and, of course, admirers of beauty. For within the enigmatic persona of Can Demirayak, one discovers an extraordinary fusion of <span class="about-highlight">unbelievable intelligence</span>, <span class="about-highlight">irresistible handsomeness</span>, and <span class="about-highlight">unparalleled humility</span>.</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Let's embark on a journey through my mind, a labyrinthine realm where ideas frolic and knowledge becomes a mere plaything. Quantum mechanics? Child's play. Astrophysics? More like Astro-basics. I've engaged in spirited debates with Einstein, sipped tea with Newton, and even enlightened Stephen Hawking about the universe's mysteries. They were mere humble apprentices in my presence, basking in the brilliance that radiates from my every synapse. (These encounters are purely hypothetical, but if they were to happen, they would transpire exactly as described.)</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">However, it's not only my intellect that captivates attention; my physical beauty could humble Adonis himself. My chiseled jawline rivals that of a Greek statue, while my sparkling eyes possess the power to mesmerize anyone who gazes upon them. Some say that the mere reflection of my face has caused many hearts to skip a beatâ€”so much so that doctors worldwide are recommending it as an alternative to cardio workouts.</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">In the realm of fashion, I reign as a trendsetter. Designers beg me to showcase their creations, fully aware that even a simple potato sack would become the latest haute couture in my hands. My sense of style is so impeccable that the fashion police have given up attempting to arrest me and instead declared me their fashion emperor, bowing down to my flawless taste.</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Let's not overlook my stupendous charisma. For merely looking good is not enough if one does not posess the personality to use it! My magnetic allure draws people to me like moths to a particularly attractive flame. With a single raised eyebrow, I can command a room, and my wit is as sharp as a samurai sword folded over a thousand times by a thousand masters. Presidents and world leaders secretly seek my counsel, fully aware that my words possess the power to resolve conflicts, cure diseases, and even make the most stubborn telemarketers hang up in shame.</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Yet, amidst all this grandeur, I remain extraordinarily humble. Even though I could have effortlessly ruled the world, I choose to grace it with my presence, enlightening the masses with my wisdom and brightening their days with my radiant looks. So, the question persists: Who is Can Demirayak? A legend, a prodigy, a beacon of brilliance? Perhaps. But ultimately, I'm a humble mortal who simply happens to embody the very concept of perfection.</p>

      <h3>Slurp Quest</h3>
      <p>Made for the 6th anniversary of Slurpwis. One of the few streamers out there who actually do something interesting! The gameplay itself is quite boring as the game is mostly about the funny references and jokes, so no point in playing if you have already seen it. Oh also, unfortunately this game was a <i>bit</i> rushed. It might look fine on the outside, but inside? Well... let's just say that it is NOT the cleanest nor the most optimised code I have ever written. But it is working, and it is a complete game. That is all that matters!</p>

      <h3>Bad Space Shooter</h3>
      <p>This was a game I made to understand the process of putting something up in the Google Play Store. I have also learned how to implement ads in my games and proceeded to gain exactly 0.00 dollars. Unfortunately the game has been removed from the store as I have stopped updating it. I also wasn't able to find any builds of the game so the download button will take you to the Unity project folder instead (Haven't managed to turn it into a build. Way too many errors in this bad boy!). You might try opening it in Unity and mess around with it.</p>

      <h3>Terra Incognita</h3>
      <p>Long have I harbored a fascination for subjects such as economics, demographics, logistics, and the lifecycle of large organizations like empires, how their parts all keep moving, changing and effecting each other and the world outside of the organisation. I wanted to make a ridiculously deep strategy game. Terra Incognita is supposed to have the complexity of paradox games like Victoria (but EVEN DEEPER) and the fun and exploration of a game like Civilization. It is nowhere near a fun or even playable game yet. But I believe it might get there one day!</p>

      <h3>Dungeon Delver</h3>
      <p>I have had a bit of a falling out with Unity in the past. Dungeon Delver is a result of that breakup and my subsequent attempts of finding a better engine. Unfortunately after some time trying to get used to Godot I have realized that just like a battered wife returning to her husband I had to return to Unity. Therefore, this project is officially abandoned. HOWEVER! I am quite proud of my level generator. The pixel art also looks quite cute not gonna lie.</p>

      <h3>Big Honey</h3>
      <p>Big Honey is a simple website, you have a button, you press the button, honey gets bigger. Quite simple. The real question is, how big can honey get? Now you might ask "Why is it called a download button and not a visit the site button?" well, because I like it when there is order and uniformity. (!!!The site is temporarily down!!!)</p>

      <p>I wouldn't want to give any spoilers here as it is meant to be a surprise for the anniversary. But let's just say that this one will be a real banger! <small>(If I can actually implement all the features I have planned without losing my will to live.)</small></p>

      <h3>Peasant King</h3>
      <p>I can say only two things about Peasant King. Firstly, it is my dream game. It is the game I have always wanted to play, and you know what they say "If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself!" The second thing is this, Peasant King WILL be finished! I WILL turn this idea into reality no matter what happens! No matter how much blood, sweat, and tears it costs, THE. JOB. WILL. BE. DONE.</p>
